## Project Implementation

The website contains three pages: Index, About and Tickets.

### Page Wrapper

Each page is placed within a wrapper with a **maximum width** of `1351px`.

There is a Header, Main and Footer section on all three pages. The contents of each section are placed in a **centered** container, which is set to a `max-width` of `1013px`.

#### Header

The first part of each page is the Header. It is hidden on screen sizes up to **768px**, and is only visible from **768px**.

The Header is divided into two sections, that are laid out using **flexbox**. To ensure there is a gap between the Logo and the Main Menu, in the second section, a **left margin** of `175px` is applied to the Main Menu. The links within the Menu are also made to **grow** and **shrink** on a scale of **1**, and given an initial width of **auto**, so that they respond to changes in screen size.

#### Main

Each page contains a Main to wrap sections specific to that page.

#### Footer

### Index

### About

### Tickets
